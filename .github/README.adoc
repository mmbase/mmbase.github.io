= mmbase.github.io

Source code for https://www.mmbase.org, which replaces the original web-site on the server, which was taken down a few years ago.

I opted for using adoc, rather then md. Firstly because I think it simply is better, secondly because we used docbook in MMBase a long time ago already.

Sadly this requires a build then, but all this is arranged via gitlab actions, so it's quite transparent
